# get-whois-from-asn-list
Get Whois details of multiple ASNs or Prefixes.

You have to provide a list of AS numbers or prefixes as a text file. One ASN or prefix per line. You have to wirte "AS", right front of the ASNs.
Whatever is in a line, whois query will go with the whole line, so just make a list with that in mind.
